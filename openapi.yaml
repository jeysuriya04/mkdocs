  description: |
    The Entitlement Management System (EMS) acts as a bridge between all the Trimble Businesses by creating a unified view of Trimble’s products for customers. Entitlements utilize Trimble Identity as a gateway to connect users to their licensed products and services and as the source for licensing end-users products and services. A product should be set-up before Entitlements can be engaged. EMS v4.1 is an upgraded version of the Entitlement Management System, designed to provide a unified view of Trimble's products for customers. This version offers improvements in response format and orchestration processes.                 <br><b>Last Updated Date: 2023-Dec-22

        You can use the API to update the details of an entitlement. When you update an entitlement, it will be notified to the users through email. The link for the events docs is given below:
        [Events Documentation](https://docs.trimblecloud.com/events/)

        **Notes**:
        - `type` can be updated only from `delayed` to `standard` types.
        - `startDate`, `endDate`, `status`, `accountId`, and `sku` can be updated only if there are no licenses issued against that entitlement.

The new version of entitlement will have the same `id`\r\n * If `isImmediate` flag is set to `true` operation will happen instantly, and current entitlement version's `endDate` will be updated to current dateTime \r\n * If `isImmediate` flag is set to `false` operation will get scheduled at the `endDate` of the current entitlement version. If no `endDate` is present the orchestration cannot be created\r\n * Changes requested as part of this orchestration will be reflected in new version and current version entitlement will expire\r\n * If the `startDate` is not specified in request, the new entitlement version will have the `startDate` same as the existing entitlement version's `endDate` \r\n * If the `endDate` is not specified in request, the new entitlement version will not have the `endDate`\r\n * `jobInfo` will provide detailed information about status and reasons for failure if any\r\n * Exisiting version of the entitlement will be in `disabled` state once orchestration is successful"
